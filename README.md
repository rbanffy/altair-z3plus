# altair-z3plus

Docker image for running an Altair Z-80 based computer with Z3PLUS on CP/M Plus

To start the service locally, run:

```shell
docker run -p 8823:8823 rbanffy/altair-z3plus
```

When the service comes up, it listens to port 8823. The emulated machine boots under CP/M Plus. In order to start MP/M, the first user to connect (running `telnet localhost 8823`) needs to run the MPM.COM program, which loads and starts the MP/M II environment:

At this point, you are in the MP/M prompt. It shows the current user number (from 0 to 15) and the currently active drive. Up to four users can connect at the same time, and will automatically be directed to different user areas.

## Contents of the Docker image

| Drive | Contents                      |
| ----- | ----------------------------- |
| A:    | System disk + Z3PLUS          |
| B:    | Second Z3PLUS disk            |
| C:    | Sorcim's SuperCalc 2          |
| D:    | Ashton and Tate's dBase II    |
| E:    | MicroPro's WordStar Release 4 |
| F:    | Microsoft's Multiplan 4       |
| G:    | Miscellaneous games           |
| H:    | Miscellaneous applications    |
| I:    | First hard drive, empty       |
| J:    | Second hard drive, empty      |

All files in the disk images are in user area 0.

## Creating empty disk images

In order to create an empty 8GB (the largest size supported under CP/M) hard disk image, use the `dd` utility:

```shell
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=8192 | tr '\000' '\345' > empty_hard_disk.dsk
```

To create an empty 8" floppy image, use:

```shell
dd if=/dev/zero bs=137 count=8128 | tr '\000' '\345' > empty_floppy.dsk
```
